## Naughts and Crosses
 Standard naughts and crosses (tic-tac-toe) with the option to play with a twist.

# About
 This is made/being made using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The purpose of this project is to improve my coding competency and problem solving in my spare time as a medical student. I have made many projects like this in the past; games, simulations and tools. These projects have made me more competent at programming, but there is still a lot to improve on. The things I want to focus on in this project are:
  * Concise and easily readable code
  * Easily managable code
  * Creating a structured project which can help me with managing larger projects in the future.
  * And lastly, is using git to track my code
This last point is a big weakness for me as I have only used git as I programmed (rather than uploading the porject post-completion) once (with minor success but improvements could be made).

# The Twist
 The twist is that you only get 3 turns that are active at one time, with each turn staying for 2 more turns after it is played.
